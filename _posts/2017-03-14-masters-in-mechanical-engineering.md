MSc Thesis: “Small Wind Turbine Design w/Bladed v4.3”<br>
Tested the capabilities of Bladed v4.3 and its CAE solving accuracy.

MASTER’S COURSE PROJECTS:<br>
• Computer Aided Fatigue Analysis
Used Adams and nCode DesignLife to design and determine fatigue on a notched beam.

• Finite Element Analysis
Used SolidWorks to design and test an elastomer for use in a metal forming punch process.

• Integrated Management Systems
Developed and applied ISO 9001, 14001, and 18001 standards to a fictitious company.

• Measurement Systems
Designed and calibrated a digital thermometer using LabVIEW and an RTD.

• Product Design and Development
Designed and developed a simple tool starting from sketches, to foam modeling, and finishing with a 3D SolidWorks model.

• Simulation of Mechanical Systems
Used ANSYS Fluent to design and determine the efficiency of a wall heater vs. a UHF induction heater in the same room. Also virtually designed and validated a Whitworth quick return mechanism.
